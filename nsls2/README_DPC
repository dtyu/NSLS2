				Differential Phase Contrast (DPC) imaging						What it includes----------------dpc.py : general functional modules for conducting DPCdpc_gui.py: a GUI for DPC based on PyQTdpc_gui_kernel.py: DPC calculation kernel used by dpc_gui.pyHow to test dpc.py------------------dpc.py contains a function called dpc_workflow() apart from other functions forDPC. dpc_workflow() is an example function, which conducts DPC using functional modules defined in dpc.py. dpc_worflow() sets all the parameters for DPC calculation. It only requires ainput file folder containing diffraction patterns in your home directory. Ifyour system is installed with wget and unzip, it will automatically downloadsand decompress the input file folder to your home directory. So you might justneed to run the dpc.py script to get a quick DPC running test. The results willoutput to your home directory as well.The input files can be manually downloaded at "https://www.dropbox.com/s/963c4ymfmbjg5dm/SOFC.zip". Please decompress it to your home directory if you want to test_workflow().Licensing---------Copyright (c) Brookhaven National Lab 2O14All rights reservedBSD LicenseSee LICENSE for full text
