				Differential Phase Contrast (DPC) imaging						What it includes----------------dpc.py : general functional modules for conducting DPCdpc_controller.py : an example script for conducting DPC using functional modules in dpc.pyHow to test dpc_controller.py-----------------------------The controller conducts the DPC calculation using a specific data set. It needs some hard 
coding as shown in line 136 and line 157. The data set also requires the fitting results to 
be scaled as shown in line 178 ~ 181.
It only requires an input file folder containing diffraction patterns in your home directory 
(~/SOFC/). If your system is installed with wget and unzip, it will automatically downloads 
and decompresses the input file folder to your home directory. So you might just need to run 
the controller script to get a quick DPC running test. The results will output to your home 
directory as well.The input files can be manually downloaded at "https://www.dropbox.com/s/963c4ymfmbjg5dm/SOFC.zip". Please decompress it to your home 
directory if you want to run the example code for DPC.Licensing---------
